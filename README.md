# 🗓️ C++ Problem Solving - Level 04 (Dates & Validation)

This repository contains **65 fully-documented C++ problems** from **Level 04** of my problem-solving journey.  
The focus of this level is **Dates, Validation, and String Manipulation** — solving common real-world problems using structured and reusable code.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered
- ✅ Date Structures (`stDate`, `stPeriod`)  
- ✅ Leap Year Checks  
- ✅ Date Validation  
- ✅ Date Comparisons (Before, Equal, After)  
- ✅ Period Overlap & Days Counting  
- ✅ String Manipulation (`SplitString`, `ReplaceWordInString`)  
- ✅ Formatting Dates with Custom Patterns  
- ✅ Console Input / Output Handling  

---


- Each file is a **self-contained C++ solution**.  
- All functions are documented using `@brief`, `@param`, and `@return` tags.  
- Problem descriptions are included at the top of each file.

## 🚀 Example Problem

**Problem 65 - Format Date**

```cpp
string FormateDate(stDate Date, string DateFormat = "dd/mm/yyyy") {
    string FormattedDateString = DateFormat;
    FormattedDateString = ReplaceWordInString(FormattedDateString, "dd", to_string(Date.Day));
    FormattedDateString = ReplaceWordInString(FormattedDateString, "mm", to_string(Date.Month));
    FormattedDateString = ReplaceWordInString(FormattedDateString, "yyyy", to_string(Date.Year));
    return FormattedDateString;
}
